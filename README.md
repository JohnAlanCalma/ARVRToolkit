### Note: In Beta

The primary goal of this toolkit is to load Autodesk content into the Unity platform.  Once you have Autodesk data, such as BIM/AEC or manufacturing content, inside Unity, you can start to build out more complex AR/VR experiences with Hololens, Apple's ARKit, Vive, Oculus, DayDream and GearVR.
